1️⃣ Initial / New Load (Full Load)

Definition:

The very first time you load data from a source system into your target system (like a data warehouse).

You load all the data from the source, regardless of size.

Key Points:

Happens once at the start.

Often used when setting up a new data warehouse or pipeline.

Can be slow if the data is large, because all rows are loaded.

Example (E-Commerce Orders):

Source: MySQL table orders with 1,000,000 rows.

Target: Data warehouse table dw_orders.

First Load SQL:

SELECT * FROM orders;


All 1,000,000 rows are copied to dw_orders.

After this, you store last loaded timestamp or max order_id to track new data.

Analogy:

Moving all your clothes from one house to another when you first shift.

2️⃣ Incremental Load

Definition:

After the first load, you load only new or updated records from the source.

Avoids reloading everything every time, making ETL faster and more efficient.

Key Points:

Happens repeatedly, e.g., daily, hourly.

Only fetches new or changed rows.

Often uses timestamps (updated_at) or IDs (auto-increment).

Example (E-Commerce Orders):

Yesterday’s last order ID in dw_orders = 1,000,000

Today, 10,000 new orders are in MySQL (order_id 1,000,001 to 1,010,000)

Incremental Load SQL:

SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_id > 1000000;


Only 10,000 new rows are loaded into dw_orders.

Analogy:

Moving only the new clothes you bought after shifting.

3️⃣ Side-by-Side Comparison
Feature	Initial / Full Load	Incremental Load
When it happens	First time	After initial load, ongoing
Data fetched	All data	Only new/updated rows
Speed	Slow (all data)	Fast (small data)
Resource Usage	High	Low
Use case	Setting up data warehouse	Daily/hourly updates, analytics
4️⃣ Simple Visual Example

Imagine your orders table:

order_id	order_date	customer_id
1	2025-09-19	101
2	2025-09-19	102
3	2025-09-20	103

Initial Load: Load all 3 rows to warehouse.

Incremental Load: Tomorrow, a new order comes:

order_id	order_date	customer_id
4	2025-09-21	104

Only load order_id 4 into warehouse.

✅ Takeaway:

Initial load = full load of all historical data

Incremental load = small load of only new/changed data
