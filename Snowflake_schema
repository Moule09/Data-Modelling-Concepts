Snowflake Schema Overview

Definition:

A schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables (sub-dimensions).

Keeps data more organized and reduces redundancy.

Multi-Level Dimensions

Instead of one big dimension table (like in Star Schema), we split it into smaller tables.

Example:

Product Dimension â†’ Product_Subcategory â†’ Product_Category


Here, Product table stores product info, Product_Subcategory stores subcategory, and Product_Category stores category.

Fact table still connects to the lowest-level dimension (Product), but you can join multiple levels for detailed analysis.

Advantages

Less data redundancy â€“ same category doesnâ€™t repeat for every product.

Efficient storage â€“ smaller tables for large datasets.

Better for detailed hierarchies â€“ like region â†’ country â†’ state â†’ city.

Drawbacks

Slower queries â€“ because you may need multiple joins to get descriptive info.

Harder to maintain â€“ more tables to manage, updates can be tricky.

Star vs Snowflake Quick Comparison
Feature	Star Schema	Snowflake Schema
Dimension Tables	Denormalized	Normalized
Redundancy	Higher	Lower
Query Performance	Faster	Slower
Storage	More	Less
Maintenance	Simple	Complex
Example Use Case	Quick dashboards, OLAP	Large datasets, normalized hierarchies

ðŸ’¡ Key Tip to Remember:

Star Schema â†’ think speed and simplicity â†’ denormalized, good for quick analysis.

Snowflake Schema â†’ think storage efficiency and hierarchy â†’ normalized, good for large, complex datasets.
