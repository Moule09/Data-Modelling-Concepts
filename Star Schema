Star Schema Overview

Tables in Star Schema

Fact Table

Stores measurable or quantitative data (e.g., sales amount, quantity sold).

Usually contains millions of rows.

Keys: foreign keys that connect to dimension tables.

Dimension Tables

Stores descriptive or textual data (e.g., product name, customer info, location).

Smaller in size compared to fact tables.

Keys: primary key used by fact table as foreign key.

Why use Fact and Dimension tables

Reduce redundancy – you store descriptive info only in dimension tables, not repeatedly in fact tables.

Query performance – fact table is connected to dimensions in a simple, direct way.

Less storage – avoids storing huge textual info repeatedly in the fact table.

Single-level Dimensions

Fact table directly connects to dimension tables without intermediate layers.

Example:

       Product Dimension
              |
       Customer Dimension
              |
           Fact Table (Sales)


Here, the fact table “Sales” has foreign keys to Product and Customer, and stores measures like sales_amount or quantity_sold.

Denormalized Design

Dimensions may contain repeated data for simplicity and speed.

Example:

Product_ID	Product_Name	Product_Category
1	Laptop	Electronics
2	Mouse	Electronics
3	Shirt	Apparel

Notice Product_Category repeats – this is denormalization.

Advantages

Faster querying for analytics.

Easy to understand and use for reports.

Drawbacks

Data repetition → more storage in dimension tables.

Updates can be tricky (if category changes, need to update multiple rows).
